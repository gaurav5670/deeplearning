## Hints
* Minsky and Papert's paper
* Feedback NN = Recurrent NN : Dynamic, continuously changing until an equilibrium is found; changes again once another input is introduced
* Automatic Representation <= Hidden layer
* Perceptrons : local features (sparse connectivity)
* Associative Mapping : Auto-association :: pattern completion
* Associative Mapping : Hetero-association :: Nearest Neighbour Recall, Interpolative Recall (classification is a special case)
* Regularity Detection : Feature discovery and Knowledge Representation
* Based on weights, *Fixed* vs *Adaptive* Networks
* Supervised Learning : *Error-correction, Reinforcement, Stochastic* Learning
* Unsupervised Learning : *Hebbian* and *Competitive* Learning (detect emerging collective properties
* Offline, Online learning
* Activation = Transfer Function
* Sensor Fusion to learn complex relationship among sensor values
* Instant Physician : Auto-associative Memory Neural Network
