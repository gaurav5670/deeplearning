# Hints

* Long-term knowledge is stored in the weights of the connections
* Automatic Internal Representation involves learning
* Distributed Representation : An input vector is represented by acitivity of certain hidden units (firing of particular set of neurons)
* Localist Representation : each hidden unit represents a meaningful feature 
* Structured knowledge
* Distributed representation is unintelligible

> Symbolic AI :  based on high-level "symbolic" (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search

* Cross-over phenomena
* Representational power 
* Automatic learning, massively parallel computation
